# Game of Apps Mini React Project
Project worked on in June 2020

This is a quick website I build using ReactJS in preparation for a summer internship as a web developer.
Going into the project, I was familiar with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but had not heard of React. So I took this opportunity
to learn how to work with React to prepare for the job to come. 

With this project, I focused mainly on learning how to use existing React components, rather than creating ones on my own from scratch. 
The React components that I did end up using had base components from the amazing [Material Ui Library](https://material-ui.com/).

A few other tools were used for this job:
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) was used a my package manager
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) was used to more easily incorportate CSS styles into the React components. 
- And of course, [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) was used to build essentially all of the site's user interface. 

This project can be run with yarn installed with the command ```yarn start```.
